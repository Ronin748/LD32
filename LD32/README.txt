Theme: An Unconventional Weapon

This game was made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare game making competition. It was programmed in C++ using SDL2.
Music by Kevin MacLeod

The game is sort of an amalgamation of An Unconventional Weapon and Companion. Cats and dogs are companions to us 
humans, but why not use them as weapons?

You are lost in the woods and the night is falling. You have to find your way back to your cabin, 
but can't recall where you came from. It's as if the forest around you is changing... There are monsters that 
roam the vast wilderness and you don't seem to have any weapons on your person...

There are 2 commands: attack (E) and defend (Q). These will alter your companion's behaviour. In attack mode 
your companion will attack everything and might wander off if the leash is not attached. In defense mode your 
companion will stay close to you and attack only aggressive animals. Attaching the leash by pressing R will cause 
your companion to follow you (even in attack mode). When it gets dark, you must defend yourself from the darkness
by turning on your lantern (press F). Each day the cabin will be further away and more monsters will spawn. Sleeping
in your cabin restores health, oil and you gain xp. You can also upgrade your companion's stats (attack, defense, speed).

IMPORTANT NOTE: changing out of the window will mess up texture alpha values (screen goes completely black), restart to fix
